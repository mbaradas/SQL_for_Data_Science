Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000
ii. Business table = 10,000
iii. Category table = 10,000
iv. Checkin table = 10,000
v. elite_years table = 10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table = 10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000
ix. review table = 10,000
x. tip table = 10,000
xi. user table = 10,000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = primary key (id) 10,000
ii. Hours = foreign key (business_id) 1,562
iii. Category = foreign key (business_id) 2,643
iv. Attribute = foreign key (business_id) 1,115
v. Review = primary key (id) 10,000; foreign key (business_id) 8,090; foreign key (user_id) 9,581
vi. Checkin = foreign key (business_id) 493
vii. Photo = primary key (id) 10,000; foreign key (business_id) 6,493
viii. Tip = foreign key (user_id) 537; foreign key (business_id) 3,979
ix. User = primary key (id) 10,000
x. Friend = foreign key (user_id) 11
xi. Elite_years = foreign key (user_id) 2,780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no

	OR compliment_cool IS NULL
	OR compliment_funny IS NULL
	OR compliment_writer IS NULL
	OR compliment_photos IS NULL;

	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes. The 2-3 stars group have longer hours than the 4-5 stars group.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes. One of the businesses in the 4-5 stars group has a significantly higher number of reviews than the 2-3 stars group.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
No. The location of the businesses are in different zip codes. The results also only returned 4 businesses, therefore the sample set could be too small to infer more useful information.

SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT bus.name,
	bus.review_count,
	hou.hours,
	bus.postal_code,
	CASE 
		WHEN hours LIKE "%monday%"
			THEN 1
		WHEN hours LIKE "%tuesday%"
			THEN 2
		WHEN hours LIKE "%wednesday%"
			THEN 3
		WHEN hours LIKE "%thursday%"
			THEN 4
		WHEN hours LIKE "%friday%"
			THEN 5
		WHEN hours LIKE "%saturday%"
			THEN 6
		WHEN hours LIKE "%sunday%"
			THEN 7
		END AS day_of_week,
	CASE 
		WHEN bus.stars BETWEEN 2
				AND 3
			THEN '2-3 stars'
		WHEN bus.stars BETWEEN 4
				AND 5
			THEN '4-5 stars'
		END AS star_group

FROM business bus

INNER JOIN hours hou
	ON bus.id = hou.business_id

INNER JOIN category cat
	ON cat.business_id = bus.id

WHERE (
		bus.city = 'Phoenix'
		AND cat.category LIKE 'Restaurants'
		)
	AND (
		bus.stars BETWEEN 2
			AND 3
		OR bus.stars BETWEEN 4
			AND 5
		)

GROUP BY bus.stars,
	day_of_week

ORDER BY day_of_week,
	star_group ASC;

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
Open businesses have more average reviews than closed business.  
 +---------------------+---------+-------------------+-------------------+---------------+
| COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) | is_open | AVG(review_count) | SUM(review_count) |    AVG(stars) |
+---------------------+---------+-------------------+-------------------+---------------+
|                1520 |       0 |     23.1980263158 |             35261 | 3.52039473684 |
|                8480 |       1 |     31.7570754717 |            269300 | 3.67900943396 |
+---------------------+---------+-------------------+-------------------+---------------+      
         
ii. Difference 2:
Open businesses have a higher average star rating than closed businesses.        
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)),
  is_open,
	AVG(review_count),
	SUM(review_count),
	AVG(stars)

FROM business

GROUP BY is_open;
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
For every review, what is the relationship with the count of stars to the count of keywords 'love' or 'hate' in the review text? Can certain keywords in a review text indicate the number of stars in the ratign review?
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
In the review table I will need the star ratings and review text. Correlating the star rating of each review with the respective star rating will be better, then using the average rating of a business in a business table.
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
 +------------+------------+------------+
| star_group | love_count | hate_count |
+------------+------------+------------+
| 0-1 star   |         85 |         52 |
| 2-3 stars  |        224 |         67 |
| 4-5 stars  |       1471 |        113 |
+------------+------------+------------+        
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
SELECT CASE 
		WHEN stars BETWEEN 0
				AND 1
			THEN '0-1 star'
		WHEN stars BETWEEN 2
				AND 3
			THEN '2-3 stars'
		WHEN stars BETWEEN 4
				AND 5
			THEN '4-5 stars'
		END AS star_group,
	SUM(CASE 
			WHEN TEXT LIKE '%love%'
				THEN 1
			ELSE 0
			END) AS love_count,
	SUM(CASE 
			WHEN TEXT LIKE '%hate%'
				THEN 1
			ELSE 0
			END) AS hate_count

FROM review

GROUP BY star_group

ORDER BY star_group ASC;
